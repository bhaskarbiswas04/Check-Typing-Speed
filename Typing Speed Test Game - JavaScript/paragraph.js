    "A computer is a widely used device. Almost every family has a computer. It can perform various functions and make our lives easier. It has four main parts: Monitor, Keyboard, CPU, and Mouse. A Computer can be used to send and receive messages and emails. It also has features like the paint tool, notepad, and calculator. It allows us to store and modify data. A computer is a very reliable device and is used everywhere, starting from schools to offices to medical fields. The only disadvantage of a computer is that we depend too much on it and use it to complete even the easiest of tasks. Even if that is the case, there is nothing that a computer cannot do for us. Scientists are working every day to improve the quality of computers. Having basic knowledge about computers is important in this generation so that work can be done easily.",
    "One of the most important factors of being a respectable and honourable person is being honest. Man’s character is incomplete if he doesn’t possess the virtue of honesty. Being truthful, not only to others but also to yourself, can be extremely rewarding. Honesty leads to ultimate happiness. It makes life easier. Honest people tend to live stress-free lives without any negative influence. They also have a positive impact on others. People naturally flock towards them. Sincere people are incredibly influential in their fields. That is why; people in business who lie to their customers always find themselves in difficult spots. A person who lies can never find solace and forever remains in anxiety. He tells a hundred other lies to cover up his initial lie. The cycle goes on until he finds himself stuck with no way out other than coming clean. Possessing the courage to be honest in the toughest of situations gives a man more strength. It leads him to a more beautiful and fulfilling life.",
    "The living and the non-living together constitute the environment. Environment makes life possible on earth, providing the means for existence. However, living beings do not appreciate the environment well enough. Environmental health is on a rapid decline. What started with using natural resources like wood, fossil fuels, and water balance has gotten so out of hand that natural resources are at the brink of vanishing forever.Pollution caused by man is the most significant reason for the environment’s degradation. Water, land, soil, and noise pollution are toxic to the environment. Throwing out garbage here and there, washing clothes and dishes in the pond and river water using chemical soap causes water pollution. As a result, the creatures living in the water end up dying. The increase in vehicles on the road causes air pollution, and it causes a spike in gases like CO2 and SO2 (greenhouse gases) that cause acid rain, which destroys buildings and monuments. Continuous honking on the roads by vehicles results in noise pollution. Pollution affects the environment and harms us, and it affects our health and causes various cardiac and respiratory diseases. If environmental pollution is not controlled, living on earth will become tougher, and finally, it will lead to the destruction of humankind.",
    "The unusual and fast increase in Earth’s average temperature is called Global Warming. This increase has considerably been higher in the last century due to human intervention with nature. The release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been one of the primary reasons behind the increase in temperature. The increased consumption of fossils fuels has increased the concentration of greenhouse gases. The impact of Global Warming is much higher than just a jump in temperature. It modifies the rainfall pattern, intensifies coastal erosion, lengthens seasons according to geography, the glaciers and ice caps are melting, and increases the range of chronic and infectious diseases. To be able to predict further climate changes, scientists built models. These climate models are used to simulate the interactional responses of the ocean and atmosphere. They predict an increase of around 2*C to 6*C by the 21st century. Further, the melting of Ice Caps and Glaciers is also exposing dark ocean water during sunlight. The upsurge in water vapour is also alarming, as it is a potent greenhouse gas and keeps temperature habitable for people. Due to the increase in temperature, water vapour evaporates and moves from the surface to the atmosphere causing an increase in temperatures. Another affected area is that of clouds; they are responsible for cooling and absorb infrared energy, which affects their working. The change in the environment has also altered our lives. We are likely to live an unhealthy life than that of our previous generations.",
    "A book can be defined as a collection of stories, incidents, and facts in written or image format. A book is a medium of information. It is one of the best companions a person can have. Books encourage creativity and the imaginative power of the mind. They enrich the thought process and help in updating one’s vocabulary. Books are a vessel for spreading wisdom. Without books, one cannot learn how to read and write. A person’s development depends on the kind of books he reads. Books provide us with knowledge about the physical aspects of the world and guide us through life. Without books, the advancement of our civilization would have been complicated. Books have given the answers to the most challenging questions time and again. Without them, many secrets of the universe would have been unknown. That is why; books are one of the significant components of leading a healthy and happy life. If everyone reads books, only then the cultural and mental development of people will be possible.",
    "My father is one of my teachers. He has taught me some of the essential things in life. My dad taught values like honesty, punctuality, manners, bravery, etc., that we don’t learn in schools. He even showed me other stuff like reading a newspaper, riding a bicycle, and travelling alone. Besides all this, he also helps me with my studies and homework. Whenever I can’t solve a problem, I approach him, and he can always solve it. My father is the only breadwinner in our family. He works relentlessly hard only to see his family happy. Without his hard work and sacrifices, it would have been very tough for us. My father is the one who pays for my education, food, home, and even entertainment and works to provide me with comfort and luxury. Sometimes my dad is rigorous. He will scold me and try to discipline me the hard way, which I’m not too fond of most of the time, but then I realized that he does that for my sake. He wants me to turn into an exceptional individual as an adult, and that is why he is strict with me. But I can proudly say that my father loves me a lot and is willing to do a lot for me, and that is why I will always respect and love him.",
    "Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.",
    "The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the new season; I believe there is much to be excited about. Although they lost, it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last year. The Blue Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork and came back to tie the game. The team had 15 hits and scored 8 runs. That’s excellent! Unfortunately, they had 5 fielding errors, which kept the other team in the lead the entire game. The game ended with the umpire making a bad call, and if the call had gone the other way, the Blue Whales might have actually won the game. It wasn’t a victory, but I say the Blue Whales look like they have a shot at the championship, especially if they continue to improve.",
